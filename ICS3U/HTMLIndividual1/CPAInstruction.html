	<small><p><sup>1</sup> Credit-hour is an input measure meant to reflect student time required to earn credit for the course. Generally, a three-credit course requires 33 hours of contact time (lecture, and so on) or 132 hours of student engagement time (lectures, tutorial, practice activities, testing or assessment, or preparation).</p></small>


	<h2>Fourth: Accumulate work experience for a period of time</h2>
	<p>After pass the CFE, a total of <mark>30 months of internship or formal work experience</mark> is required to complete the <ins>Practical Experience Requirements(CPA PER)</ins>.</p>
	<p>
		There are two routes you can take:<br>
		<b> - CPA pre-approved programs:</b> in which future CPAs gain relevant experience in training positions pre-approved by the profession.<br>
		<b> - Experience verification:</b> in which future CPAs demonstrate relevant experience at an employer of their choice.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are five common elements that support both routes:<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • You gain relevant experience and develop as a professional accountant in a minimum of 30 months.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Your experience must be appropriately supervised.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • You must record detailed reports at regular intervals.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • You must meet and discuss your progress at least semi-annually with a CPA mentor.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Your experience is assessed by the CPA profession.
	</p>
	<p>It will take you at least two years to become a CPA and part of the reason is because this part takes much more time to complete.</p>
