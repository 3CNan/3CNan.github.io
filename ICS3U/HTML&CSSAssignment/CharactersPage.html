		<p>Sora and Shiro are two hikikomori step-siblings who are known in the online gaming world as Blank, an undefeated group of gamers. One day, they are challenged to a game of chess by Tet, a god from another reality. The two are victorious and are offered to live in a world that centers around games. They accept, believing it to be a joke, and are summoned to a reality known as Disboard. There, a spell known as the Ten Pledges prevents the citizens of Disboard from inflicting harm on one another, forcing them to resolve their differences by gambling with games whose rules and rewards are magically enforced. In-game, rule enforcement only occurs when the method of cheating is acknowledged and outed by the opponent, allowing players to cheat through discreet methods. Sora and Shiro traverse to Elkia, the nation inhabited by humans, and befriend the duchess Stephanie Dola. Learning about Elkia's decline, the two participate in a tournament to determine the next ruler; after winning the crown, they earn the right to challenge the Disboard's other species as humanity's representative. Their next goal is to conquer all sixteen species in order to challenge Tet to a game; as of the sixth volume, five of the sixteen are under their control.</p>

						Sora is an eighteen-year-old male who excels at strategies and cold readings while his eleven-year-old stepsister, Shiro, excels at calculations and logic. Together, the two form the undefeated gaming identity Blank (『　』) due to their trademark of using only spaces as their in-game names.<br><br>After their parents died, the two no longer had emotional ties to society and eventually became agoraphobic and hikikomori. When the two are separated from each other, they begin to suffer panic attacks. After Sora and Shiro are summoned to Disboard, they decide to uphold their undefeated reputation as Blank by defeating Tet.

				<div id="role_dola" class="characimg">
					<div class="characinfo">
						Stephanie is a teenage girl and granddaughter to the previous king of Elkia, the nation inhabited by humans. She has a lot of explicit knowledge but lacks the intuition to win games. Her grandfather was infamously known for losing games and giving up Elkia's land. As a result, Stephanie strives to restore the honor of her grandfather and humanity. When Sora and Shiro are crowned, she becomes their assistant and deals with Elkia's economics and politics. They discover her grandfather kept hidden records on the other species which becomes an asset to their victories; her experience with Sora and Shiro improves her skill to the point that she can win against normal humans.

				<div id="role_jibril" class="characimg">
					<div class="characinfo">
						Jibril is a flügel, a powerful angelic race known for their ruthlessness. Jibril is over 6000-years old and is the youngest and most powerful of her species. She won Elkia's library from Stephanie's grandfather in order to store her books and use it as a home. After losing to Sora and Shiro in a game of Shiritori, she becomes their slave, but is treated as an equal. She often provides magic or transportation necessities for the protagonists. Later on, she begins publishing novels based on Sora and Shiro which makes them famous among the flügels.

						Izuna Hatsuse is a Warbeast girl and the former ambassador of the Warbeast race to Immanity. After Sora and Shiro forced the warbeasts to join the Commonwealth of Elkia, Izuna was directed by Miko to follow and learn from them. Sora and Shiro have a habit of petting her fur (tail) yet she seems to enjoy it (much to the chagrin of her grandfather). Stephanie has noted that she actually shares similarities to Sora and Shiro, such as lacking common sense, being arrogant towards others, and being extremely smart and competent at gaming.

					<div class="characinfo">
						Chlammy Zell is a human who allied herself with the Elves to try and win the king's contest, due to her belief that humans will never be strong enough and must depend on others to survive. She is the friend of the Elf girl Fiel Nirvalen, despite being a slave of Fiel's family.<br><br>After Sora bet the Race Piece of Immanity in their game with the Eastern Union, Chlammy Zell challenged Sora in an attempt to win the Race Piece. However, Sora tricked her into sharing his memories with her in a game of Othello. After Chlammy had seen Sora's memories, she decided to go along with him and his plan.

					<div class="characinfo">
						Fiel Nirvalen, who usually has her name shortened to Fii, is an Elf girl who is Chlammy Zell's game partner, as well as the one who helps her cheat using her elven magic. Despite her young physical appearance, she is actually around 52 years old.<br><br>It is subsequently revealed that Chlammy is actually her family's slave. Despite this, they hold a close relationship between each other. She even begs Sora to restore Chlammy's memories after the latter won them in a game. Believing that Sora's going to fulfill his words to unite all races, she now works with Chlammy to claim the leadership of Elves as she cares more about Chlammy than her own race.

		<center><h1>XVI Exceed</h1></center>
		<div id="exceedbox">
			<p>An intellectual (who can play games) species of the otherworldly "Disbode". The higher the race's suitability for cloister magic, the higher the rank.<br><br>The first to the sixth are called "life", also called "superior race", having the energy or concept of will and no clear boundary between their "soul" and "vessel" (body). The "inferior races" below seventh are "creatures", having physical bodies and reproducing by the usual means. The soul concentration between the two is so different that the race called "life" sees itself as superior to the "biological" race.<br><br>With the exception of the highest god species and the lowest human species, all other races, including the demon species created by the demon Lord, are of god origin.</p>
