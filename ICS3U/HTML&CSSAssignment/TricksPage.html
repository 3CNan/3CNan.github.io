				<div class="trvboxs">
					<div>
						<p><b>The residents of Disboard have the option to enforce absolute compliance using the Covenants.</b></p>
						<p>One of the first things Sora and Shiro did after their coronation is to ask all governors to purposely lose a game to them, and use the power of the Covenants to forbid the governors to lie or withhold information.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="trvdetail">
				<div class="trvboxs">
					
					<div>
						<p><b>Rule 8 can be ignored by expert strategists/cheaters.</b></p>
						<p>『 』(Blank) is notably good at this, even telling everyone else how others cheat.<br>The Beastmen use their superior hearing to hear whispers inaudible to humans.<br>Psyching out opponents is allowed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="trvdetail">
				<div class="trvboxs">
					<div>
						<p><b>Rule 2 does not imply to insults, allowing races to still be snide to each other.</b></p>
						<p>Slapping someone in anger is still permitting as Steph attempted to do when Sora insulted her grandfather.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="trvdetail">
				<div class="trvboxs">
					<div>
						<p><b>Rule 5 cannot be enforced if it's impossible.</b></p>
						<p>For example Sora's prize for beating Steph was for her to fall in love with him; as this can't happen unnaturally, it had to happen gradually of Steph's own will, though it should be noted that infatuation, while subtly different from love was similar enough to count as a substitute.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="trvdetail">
				<div class="trvboxs">
					<div>
						<p><b>Rule 6 only applies to when the person is alive.</b></p>
						<p>Steph's grandfather got around keeping his promise not to tell about video games by leaving a post-mortem message.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="trvdetail">
				<div class="trvboxs">
					<div>
						<p><b>Rule 10 seems to get ignored by everyone, despite Tet explicitly putting it in to make everyone realize the rules are to help them get along.</b></p>
					</div>
